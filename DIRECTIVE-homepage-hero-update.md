**Repository:** https://github.com/FlynnVIN10/OMGEN-website  
**Branch:** master  
**Priority:** High  
**Date:** January 15, 2026

## Directive

Replace the existing homepage hero section copy with new messaging that emphasizes OMGEN's unique approach to water treatment through:
- Water memory and molecular structure
- Dr. Emoto's research on water consciousness
- Frequency programming and resonance
- Negatively charged water vs. positively charged water
- Distinction between Commercial and Home sector applications

### Current Copy (TO BE REPLACED):

```
WATER TREATMENT FOR A HEALTHIER YOU
Enjoy alkaline water on tap with comprehensive water treatment that removes harmful toxins, balances pH, and enriches your drinking water with healthy, great-tasting minerals.
```

### New Copy (REPLACE WITH):

OMGEN Water has redefined the way we look at water treatment. We use magnetic fields and molecular genetics, utilizing frequency and resonance to train the memory of water for health and vitality.

OMGEN Water is not just looking at your standard water filtration and treatment methods. We are completely outside the box.

Water has a memory. Proven by Dr. Emoto's research about speaking into water and changing the molecular structure of the water from five-sided hexagon of water to six-sided structured water. OMGEN's approach is wiping the memory of the water of all the toxic frequencies and then embedding healthy frequencies of life, vitality, and health back into the water.

OMGEN Water's vision is to permanently negatively charge water across the world. Positively charged water, which is all the water on Mother Earth right now unless it's coming off of a river stream or ocean where it's vortexing, is positively charged. Positively charged water causes decay in the human body. Negatively charged water does the opposite of decay. Which water do you want to drink?

**Commercial Sector:**  
OMGEN Water can treat municipal water without the use of chemicals that are polluting the water that comes to our homes. We not only clean the water to non-detect, but we also add healthy frequencies back into the water matrix to boost energy, vitality, and a higher resonance of life-giving water.

**Home Sector:**  
OMGEN Water has solutions to take PFAS and PFOAs out of water that supplies your whole home with clean and pure water. Our upgrade systems will allow you at home to custom program your water with frequencies that are directed at imbalances in the human body.

## Context from NotebookLM

This messaging bridges the gap between Sentry's high-performance toxin removal (validated by SimpleLab/Summit Environmental Technologies) and OMGEN's focus on "Living Water Technology." 

### Key Alignment Points:

1. **Purity + Structure Bridge:**
   - Sentry technology handles "Purity" (removing PFAS, Lead, Vinyl Chloride, Arsenic 99.99%, Fluoride 99.02%)
   - OMGEN branding focuses on "Structure" (negative charge, water memory, frequency)

2. **Terminology Consistency:**
   - Use "Atomic Purification" when referring to 5-stage systems
   - Maintain proprietary media names: ToxyGuard, AlkaGuard, BioChemGuard, WellGuard
   - Replace "filtration" language with "Atomic Purification" and "Molecular Genetics"

3. **Restructuring as Core Pillar:**
   - Builds on existing Water Restructuring Devices (Apollo, Athena systems)
   - Emphasizes "permanent negative charge" that replicates water in nature
   - Frequency programming directly supports "Living Water" narrative

4. **Scientific Validation:**
   - Hero section discusses advanced concepts (water memory, frequency)
   - Technical data provides hard science foundation (99.99% Arsenic reduction, 99.02% Fluoride reduction)
   - Dual-benefit messaging: removes "harsh chemical poisons" + restores "natural negative charge"

5. **Sector Expansion:**
   - Commercial/municipal applications align with existing "Agricultural Solutions" in 5 sizes
   - "Commercial scale control" already mentioned in sources
   - Home wellness focus maintains consistency with existing product pages

## Design Input: [From Flynn/JP]

New homepage hero copy provided focuses on:
- Redefining water treatment approach
- Magnetic fields, molecular genetics, frequency, and resonance
- Water memory concept (Dr. Emoto's research)
- Five-sided vs. six-sided structured water
- Wiping toxic frequencies, embedding healthy frequencies
- Negatively charged water vision (global scale)
- Positively charged water causes decay
- Commercial sector: Municipal water treatment without chemicals
- Home sector: PFAS/PFOA removal + custom frequency programming

---

## White Label Requirements

- ✅ Ensure "Made in USA" messaging remains prominent alongside new molecular copy
- ✅ Verify all links from hero section lead to rebranded OMGEN product pages (not Sentry)
- ✅ Maintain white-label consistency: All "Sentry" references must remain as "OMGEN WATER"
- ✅ Keep product specifications identical (hardware is identical)
- ✅ Preserve lab report data attribution to OMGEN treated samples

---

## Implementation Instructions

### Location:
- File: `index.html` (or relevant homepage template)
- Section: Hero section / Above-the-fold content

### Steps:
1. Locate the current hero section text block containing "WATER TREATMENT FOR A HEALTHIER YOU"
2. Replace entire text block with new copy provided above
3. Maintain existing HTML structure and CSS classes
4. Ensure responsive design is preserved for mobile/tablet views
5. Add proper heading tags (H1/H2) for SEO optimization
6. Include semantic sectioning for Commercial Sector and Home Sector

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Text displays correctly on desktop (1920px, 1440px, 1024px)
- [ ] Text displays correctly on tablet (768px)
- [ ] Text displays correctly on mobile (375px, 414px)
- [ ] Line breaks and paragraph spacing are appropriate
- [ ] Links (if any) are functional
- [ ] SEO meta descriptions updated to reflect new messaging
- [ ] Grammar and spelling verified

## Verification

- ✅ Code updated in repository
- ✅ Tested across breakpoints
- ✅ Deployed to GitHub Pages
- ✅ DNS verified (omgenwater.com)
- ✅ "Made in USA" messaging visible
- ✅ No "Sentry" references in updated copy
- ✅ Links point to OMGEN pages (not Sentry)

## Additional Notes

- This update represents a significant shift in messaging strategy from standard filtration language to advanced water science concepts
- The new copy positions OMGEN as a thought leader in water memory, frequency programming, and negatively charged water
- Maintain balance between esoteric concepts (water memory) and hard science (lab-validated toxin removal)
- Future updates should continue this "Purity + Structure" dual messaging approach
